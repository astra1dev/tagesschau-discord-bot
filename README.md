## How to run

First, download the `bot.py` file or clone the entire repository.

## Preparations

Edit the `bot.py` file and include your bot TOKEN, a specific CHANNEL and a TIME.
Then save the file.

### Linux 
Python should already be installed on your computer. 

Type `python3 pip install discord` in the console and hit enter. \
Then type `python3 bot.py` and hit enter. Now the bot is running!

### Windows
You need Python installed on your computer. \
Download the latest version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 

Then open Command Prompt, type `python -m pip install discord` and hit enter. 

Finally open explorer and double-click `bot.py`. Now the bot is running!

#### Note

The bot uses the tagesschau API, which means all news are posted in GERMAN language.
If you don't speak german, then this is not the right bot for you.
